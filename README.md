# BMIRT
I designed and developed a suite of software (BMIRT ToolKit) for multidimensional item response theory models, which includes parameter estimation, linking, and simulation, including Multidimensional Computer Adaptative Testing (MCAT). My primary research interests include psychometric methods, mathematics and statistical methods, and software development; I have expertise in MCMC, MIRT parameter estimation and linking. In 2008, I led the first BMIRT training session at NCME. BMIRTII (Yao, 2010), the second version of BMIRT, has more enhanced features such as computing test response function, higher-order IRT for domain scores and overall scores, overall scores by the maximum information method, classification accuracy and consistency, and MIRT for detecting DIF. SimuMCAT (Yao, 2011) contains five MCAT item selection procedures, each with varying features for item exposure control and content constraints.

You can download the software BMIRT.zip, MCAT.zip, LinkMIRT.zip, SimuMIRT.zip and use them as indicated in the BMIRT.pdf, the manual.
